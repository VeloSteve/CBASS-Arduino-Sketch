# CBASS-Arduino-Sketch
 
This software is based on a version by Dan Barshis and others at Old Dominion University.  They deserve full credit for creation of the core temperature monitoring and control features.  I have modified the code heavily enough that any bugs are probably my fault. 

The one dramatic change is the addition of the ability to connect to CBASS via Bluetooth Low Energy to monitor temperatures and make limited changes to the experimental plan.  A companion app is in an early state of development.

If you want to use this code you will need a CBASS-R "shield" and you will need to build it into a full system.  Pop "CBASS coral research" into your favorite search engine to see what's going on.
